# Contributing to Sovereign Era Game

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Sovereign Era Game! We welcome contributions in many forms including code, documentation, bug reports, and feature suggestions.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- **Search First:** Check the issue tracker to see if your problem or suggestion has already been discussed.
- **Provide Details:** When opening a new issue, please include:
  - A clear description of the problem or enhancement.
  - Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
  - Expected versus actual behaviour.
  - Any error messages or log outputs.
  - Screenshots or recordings, if relevant.

### Submitting Code or Documentation
- **Fork and Branch:** Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main` for your work.
- **Follow Guidelines:** Adhere to our [Development Plan](DEV_PLAN.md) and [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for guidance on current priorities.
- **Write Clear Commits:** Make commits with descriptive messages that clearly outline your changes.
- **Pull Request:** Submit a pull request (PR) once your changes are complete. In your PR description, reference any related issues and provide a summary of your changes.
- **Code Quality:** Ensure your code is well-organized, documented, and follows [Godot's GDScript style guidelines](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/style_guide.html).

## Workflow Guidelines

1. **Branching:**  
   Create feature or bugfix branches off `main`. Avoid working directly on `main`.

   Your PR will be reviewed by team members. Be open to feedback and prepared to make adjustments.
3. **Testing:**  
   Ensure that your changes work as intended. Test locally before submitting your PR.
